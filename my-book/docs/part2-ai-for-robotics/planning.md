# Planning

If kinematics, dynamics, and control are the "body" of a robot, **planning** is the "mind." Planning is the process of reasoning about a task to find a sequence of actions that will achieve a goal. It's about deciding *what* to do, whereas control is about *how* to do it.

In robotics, planning problems exist at many levels of abstraction, from finding a collision-free path for the arm to move from point A to point B, to figuring out the sequence of steps required to assemble a product.

## The Planning Problem

A typical planning problem can be defined by:

- **State Space**: The set of all possible configurations of the world.
- **Initial State**: The state where the robot starts.
- **Goal State/Condition**: The desired state or a condition that must be met.
- **Actions**: A set of actions the robot can take, which cause transitions between states.
- **Cost Function**: A function that assigns a cost to a sequence of actions. The goal is to find a plan with the minimum cost.

## Path Planning

Path planning is one of the most fundamental planning problems in robotics. The goal is to find a geometrically valid path for a robot from a start to a goal configuration while avoiding collisions with obstacles.

To solve this, we often plan in the robot's **Configuration Space (C-Space)**. In C-Space, the robot is represented as a single point, and all the obstacles in the real world are "grown" to represent the set of robot configurations that would result in a collision. The problem then becomes finding a path for a point in this C-Space.

### Common Path Planning Algorithms

- **Grid-Based Algorithms (e.g., A\*)**: These methods discretize the C-Space into a grid and use graph search algorithms like A* to find the shortest path. A* is efficient because it uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal.
- **Sampling-Based Algorithms (e.g., RRT, PRM)**: For high-dimensional C-Spaces (robots with many joints), grid-based methods become computationally infeasible. Sampling-based planners like the **Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)** and the **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)** build a graph of reachable configurations by taking random samples from the C-Space. These methods are highly effective for complex problems.

## Motion Planning

While path planning finds a geometric path, **motion planning** also considers the robot's dynamics and constraints. It generates a full trajectory, which specifies the robot's position, velocity, and acceleration at every point in time along the path.

A trajectory is often generated by first finding a path, and then "smoothing" it and assigning a velocity profile (e.g., a trapezoidal velocity profile) to ensure the robot's velocity and acceleration limits are not exceeded.

## Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)

For many real-world problems, the robot needs to perform not just one motion, but a sequence of actions that involve both movement and interaction with objects. For example, to "get the milk from the fridge," the robot must:

1. Navigate to the fridge.
2. Open the fridge door.
3. Move its arm to the milk carton.
4. Grasp the milk.
5. Move the milk out of the fridge.
6. Close the fridge door.

This is the domain of **Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)**. TAMP is a challenging area of research that combines the high-level, symbolic reasoning of AI task planning with the low-level, geometric reasoning of motion planning.

The challenge lies in the fact that these two levels are tightly coupled: whether a high-level action (like "open the door") is possible depends on the robot's ability to find a valid motion plan for it. And the choice of which high-level action to take depends on the cost and feasibility of the resulting motions.

Modern TAMP solvers often work by iterating between a task planner that suggests a sequence of actions, and a motion planner that checks if those actions are feasible. This integration of symbolic and geometric reasoning is a key step towards creating more intelligent and capable robots.
