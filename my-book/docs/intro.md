# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course book. This book will provide a comprehensive introduction to the exciting world of humanoid robots and the artificial intelligence that powers them.

Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that is concerned with building intelligent agents that can physically interact with the world. This is in contrast to traditional AI, which is often focused on tasks that can be performed in a virtual environment, such as playing chess or translating languages.

Humanoid robotics is a subfield of physical AI that is concerned with building robots that have a human-like form. This is a challenging task, as it requires solving many problems in mechanics, control, perception, and artificial intelligence.

This book will cover the following topics:
- **Part 1: Fundamentals of Robotics**: This part will cover the basic concepts of robotics, such as kinematics, dynamics, and control.
- **Part 2: AI for Robotics**: This part will cover the artificial intelligence techniques that are used in robotics, such as perception, planning, and learning.
- **Part 3: Humanoid Robotics**: This part will cover the specific challenges of humanoid robotics, such as bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.
