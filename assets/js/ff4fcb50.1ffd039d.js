This book will provide a comprehensive introduction to the exciting world of humanoid robots and the artificial intelligence that powers them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/control-systems":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/control-systems","title":"Control Systems","description":"Having models for a robot\'s kinematics and dynamics is essential, but they are only useful if we can use them to make the robot move in a desired way. This is the role of the control system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/dynamics":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/dynamics","title":"Dynamics","description":"While kinematics describes the motion of a robot, dynamics addresses the forces and torques required to create that motion. Understanding dynamics is critical for designing controllers, simulating robot behavior, and ensuring the robot\'s structure can withstand the stresses of operation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/kinematics":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/kinematics","title":"Kinematics","description":"This chapter delves into the kinematics of robotic systems, a fundamental building block for understanding, planning, and controlling robot motion.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/learning":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/learning","title":"Machine Learning for Robotics","description":"While traditional methods in robotics rely on precise models and explicit programming, machine learning offers a powerful alternative: enabling robots to learn from data and experience. Learning allows robots to operate in unstructured environments, adapt to new situations, and acquire complex skills that would be difficult or impossible to program by hand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/perception":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/perception","title":"Perception","description":"A robot cannot act intelligently without the ability to perceive its environment. Perception is the process of taking sensory information and using it to build an internal model of the world. For a robot, this means turning raw sensor data\u2014pixels, point clouds, forces\u2014into meaningful information, such as \\"there is a door in front of me,\\" or \\"I am holding a cup.\\"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/planning":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/planning","title":"Planning","description":"If kinematics, dynamics, and control are the \\"body\\" of a robot, planning is the \\"mind.\\" Planning is the process of reasoning about a task to find a sequence of actions that will achieve a goal. It\'s about deciding what to do, whereas control is about how to do it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/bipedal-locomotion":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/bipedal-locomotion","title":"Bipedal Locomotion","description":"One of the defining characteristics of a humanoid robot is its ability to walk on two legs: bipedal locomotion. Walking is one of the most challenging problems in robotics, as it involves controlling a complex, high-dimensional, and inherently unstable system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/human-robot-interaction":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/human-robot-interaction","title":"Human-Robot Interaction","description":"As robots move from structured industrial settings into our homes, offices, and public spaces, their ability to interact with people becomes paramount. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is the field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/manipulation":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/manipulation","title":"Manipulation","description":"Beyond walking, the primary way a humanoid robot interacts with the world is through manipulation: using its hands and arms to grasp, move, and use objects. The goal of humanoid robotics is to create robots that can operate in human environments, and a key part of this is the ability to use the same tools and objects that humans do.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"create-a-blog-post","description":"You are my book-writing assistant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
