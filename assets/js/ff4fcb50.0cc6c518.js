This book will provide a comprehensive introduction to the exciting world of humanoid robots and the artificial intelligence that powers them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/control-systems":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/control-systems","title":"Control Systems","description":"In robotics, a control system is what translates a desired action into the necessary forces and torques to make the robot move as intended. It\'s the \\"brain\\" behind the brawn, ensuring precision, stability, and goal-oriented behavior.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/dynamics":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/dynamics","title":"Dynamics","description":"While kinematics describes the motion of a robot without considering the forces that cause it, dynamics is the study of motion in relation to the forces and torques that produce it. Understanding dynamics is crucial for simulating robot behavior, designing controllers, and ensuring the robot can perform its tasks without damaging itself or its environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/kinematics":{"id":"part1-fundamentals-of-robotics/kinematics","title":"Kinematics","description":"Kinematics in robotics is like understanding the robot\'s \\"anatomy\\" and how its body moves, without worrying about the muscles (forces) that make it move. It\'s the study of motion purely from a geometric perspective, focusing on the position, velocity, and acceleration of robot parts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/learning":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/learning","title":"Learning","description":"\\"Learning\\" in robotics refers to the ability of a robot to improve its performance on a task over time, often without explicit programming for every possible scenario. This is primarily achieved through various machine learning techniques, allowing robots to adapt, make decisions, and interact more intelligently with complex and unpredictable environments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/perception":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/perception","title":"Perception","description":"Perception is a robot\'s ability to \\"sense\\" and interpret its surrounding environment, much like humans use their eyes, ears, and touch. It\'s the crucial first step for any intelligent robot to interact meaningfully with the physical world, enabling it to know where it is, what\'s around it, and what\'s happening.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part2-ai-for-robotics/planning":{"id":"part2-ai-for-robotics/planning","title":"Planning","description":"Planning in robotics is the process by which a robot determines a sequence of actions to take to achieve a specific goal. It\'s akin to a human thinking through how to perform a task, considering obstacles, resources, and desired outcomes. Effective planning allows robots to operate autonomously, move efficiently, and interact intelligently with their surroundings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/bipedal-locomotion":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/bipedal-locomotion","title":"Bipedal Locomotion","description":"Bipedal locomotion, or walking on two legs, is one of the most defining characteristics of humans and a grand challenge in robotics. While it offers incredible advantages like navigating complex terrains, using tools, and interacting with human-centric environments, achieving stable and efficient bipedal walking in robots is incredibly difficult due to inherent instability and high degrees of freedom.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/human-robot-interaction":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/human-robot-interaction","title":"Human-Robot Interaction","description":"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is the study of how humans and robots can effectively and naturally work together, communicate, and coexist. For humanoid robots, which are designed to operate in human-centric environments, seamless and intuitive HRI is not just a feature but a fundamental requirement for their successful integration into society.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part3-humanoid-robotics/manipulation":{"id":"part3-humanoid-robotics/manipulation","title":"Manipulation","description":"Robot manipulation refers to the ability of a robot to interact physically with objects in its environment. For humanoid robots, this capability is crucial for performing a wide range of tasks that involve grasping, lifting, moving, and assembling items, allowing them to operate in human-designed workspaces and assist with daily chores or complex industrial processes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"part4-capstone-project/overview":{"id":"part4-capstone-project/overview","title":"Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid","description":"Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital spaces.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"create-a-blog-post","description":"You are my book-writing assistant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
